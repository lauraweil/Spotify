# Project: Spotify_ML

The goal of this project is to predict whether a song is going to be successful or not using machine learning. We have merged five datasets from Spotify and performed data cleaning and transformation on the required columns. We have then created an ML Pipeline and applied a model to it for predicting popularity.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you need to download the Spotify data from the following link and extract it to the root folder: [link](https://novasbe365-my.sharepoint.com/personal/qiwei_han_novasbe_pt/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fqiwei%5Fhan%5Fnovasbe%5Fpt%2FDocuments%2FDataset%2FSpotify%2FSpotify%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fqiwei%5Fhan%5Fnovasbe%5Fpt%2FDocuments%2FDataset%2FSpotify&ga=1)

## Data Preparation

We have merged five datasets, including Spotify charts data, Spotify track data, Spotify audio features data, Spotify artist data, and Spotify genre data. We have cleaned and transformed the data to make it suitable for our machine learning model.

## ML Pipeline

We have created an ML Pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The ML Pipeline will take in the merged dataset and perform all the necessary transformations to prepare the data for model training. We have used a Gradient Boosting Classifier model to predict the popularity of a song.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict the success of a song on Spotify. By using the merged dataset and applying an ML Pipeline with a Gradient Boosting Classifier model, we were able to achieve good accuracy in predicting the popularity of a song.
